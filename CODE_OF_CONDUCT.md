# Vanity Crypto Code of Conduct

## Core Values & Ethics

As a cryptographic tool used for financial security and asset management, we hold our contributors to a higher standard of ethics than typical open-source projects. Our core values are:

1.  **Security First**: The safety of user funds is paramount. Any attempt to introduce vulnerabilities, backdoors, or "rug pulls" will be met with immediate banning and public disclosure.
2.  **Privacy & Anonymity**: We respect the right to privacy. Contributors are free to remain anonymous (pseudonymous). Doxxing or revealing the identity of pseudonymous contributors without consent is strictly prohibited.
3.  **Intellectual Integrity**: Discussions should be grounded in mathematics, code, and technical merit. We value verifiable truth over authority.
4.  **Zero Tolerance for Scams**: Any association with phishing campaigns, Ponzi schemes, or malicious distribution of this binary will result in permanent exclusion from the community.

## Expected Behavior

*   **Responsible Disclosure**: If you find a vulnerability, you MUST report it privately via our security channels (see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md)). Publicly dropping 0-days that put user funds at risk is unacceptable.
*   **Focus on Code**: Critique the code, not the coder. Technical debates can be heated, but personal attacks are never acceptable.
*   **Transparency**: All cryptographic changes must be clearly explained and open for audit. Obfuscated code is treated as malicious by default.

## Unacceptable Behavior

*   Attempting to inject malicious code or supply-chain attacks.
*   Promoting scams, wallet drainers, or illicit financial schemes.
*   Harassment, hate speech, or discrimination of any kind.
*   "Gatekeeping" or discouraging new users who are learning about cryptography.

## Enforcement

Maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct.

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior – especially regarding security threats – may be reported to the community maintainers.
